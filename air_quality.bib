	abstract = {This paper establishes a link between an activity-based model for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), dynamic traffic assignment, emission modelling, and air quality simulation. This provides agent-based output that allows vehicle emissions to be tracked back to individuals and households who are producing them. In addition, roadway emissions are dispersed and the resulting ambient air concentrations are linked with individual time-activity patterns in order to assess population exposure to air pollution. This framework is applied to evaluate the effects of a range of policy interventions and 2031 scenarios on the generation of vehicle emissions and greenhouse gases in the GTA. Results show that the predicted increase of approximately 2.6 million people and 1.3 million jobs in the region by 2031 compared to 2001 levels poses a major challenge in achieving meaningful reductions in GHGs and air pollution.},

	abstract = {Summary In this report we review the health effects of three short-lived greenhouse pollutants—black carbon, ozone, and sulphates. We undertook new meta-analyses of existing time-series studies and an analysis of a cohort of 352 000 people in 66 US cities during 18 years of follow-up. This cohort study provides estimates of mortality effects from long-term exposure to elemental carbon, an indicator of black carbon mass, and evidence that ozone exerts an independent risk of mortality. Associations among these pollutants make drawing conclusions about their individual health effects difficult at present, but sulphate seems to have the most robust effects in multiple-pollutant models. Generally, the toxicology of the pure compounds and their epidemiology diverge because atmospheric black carbon, ozone, and sulphate are associated and could interact with related toxic species. Although sulphate is a cooling agent, black carbon and ozone could together exert nearly half as much global warming as carbon dioxide. The complexity of these health and climate effects needs to be recognised in mitigation policies.},

	abstract = {Canada's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol has focused attention on the importance of accurately estimating emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from all sectors. An inventory of emissions of greenhouse gases from Canadian municipal wastewater treatment plants was prepared using a life-cycle approach. Both on-site emissions at the treatment facility due to the biological processes used and fossil fuels consumed for energy and heat and upstream emissions related to off-site production and transmission of fuels and the off-site production of electricity for the plant were included. For the year 2000, the on-site methane (CH{\textasciicircum}sub 4{\textasciicircum}) emission rate from Canadian municipal wastewater treatment facilities was estimated at 1600 Mg/year. The total on-site emission rate of carbon dioxide (CO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum}) was estimated at 669 100 Mg/year, but the estimated total CO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum} equivalent emissions rose to 1 048 500 Mg/year once upstream emissions were included. Clear abatement strategies related to more efficient energy use and energy recovery can be identified once accurate GHG emissions inventories are in place. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Cities globally are in the midst of taking action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. After the vital step of emissions quantification, strategies must be developed to detail how emissions reductions targets will be achieved. The Pathways to Urban Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions (PURGE) model allows the estimation of emissions from four pertinent urban sectors: electricity generation, buildings, private transportation, and waste. Additionally, the carbon storage from urban and regional forests is modeled. An emissions scenario is examined for a case study of the greater Toronto, Ontario, Canada, area using data on current technology stocks and government projections for stock change. The scenario presented suggests that even with some aggressive targets for technological adoption (especially in the transportation sector), it will be difficult to achieve the less ambitious 2050 emissions reduction goals of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is largely attributable to the long life of the building stock and limitations of current retrofit practices. Additionally, demand reduction (through transportation mode shifting and building occupant behavior) will be an important component of future emissions cuts.},

	abstract = {Air pollution in developing countries is a growing concern. It is associated with urbanization and social and economic structures. The understanding of how social factors can influence the perception and the potential impact of air pollution have not been addressed sufficiently. This paper addresses the social vulnerability and exposure to PM10 association and its influence on the air quality perception of residents in Mexicali, a Mexico–US border city. This study used individual variables and population census data, as well as statistical and spatial analyses. A cluster of socially vulnerable populations with high exposure to coarse particulate matter (PM10) was found in the city’s peripheral areas. The spatial distribution of the local perception of air quality varied by the exposure zones of the estimated PM10 concentrations. Respondents living in very high exposure areas perceive air quality as “poor,” contrarily to a worse perception in areas of intermediate and lower exposure to PM10. Proximity to stationary sources of pollution was associated with a poor perception of air quality. Results also indicate that low household income and poor air quality perceived at the place of residence negatively influences the perceived changes in the air quality over time. The knowledge of chronic health effects related to air pollution was scarce in the sampled population, especially in the areas with very high exposure and high social vulnerability. These findings can serve as a support in local air quality management.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is one of the most critical concerns encountered in urban areas, especially in developing nations. Four out of five cities in the world with the worst air quality are located in India. The concentration levels of air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and suspended particulate matter (SPM), are monitored by instituted air monitoring stations. The present study assesses the spatial air quality and the fitness of spatial mapping using data collected by monitoring stations in Mumbai, India. As part of this, air quality was monitored at twelve selected locations in Mumbai city. The collected data were spatially interpolated using the available interpolation tools of ArcGIS, including inverse distance weight (IDW), kriging (spherical and Gaussian), and spline techniques by the leave-one-out scheme. In each case, the interpolated concentrations of SO2, NO2, and SPM at the eleven locations were compared to the observed values of the unmonitored locations in the corresponding region. Percentage error, normal mean bias (NMB), normal root mean square error (NRMSE), and degree of agreement (“d”) were carried out to evaluate the spatial interpolation methods adopted for air quality mapping. The spline method is not preferred for spatial mapping due to negative concentrations in many locations due to either overestimation or underestimation. The minimum average percentage error for SO2 and NO2 mapping is achieved using IDW interpolation, while SPM mapping is achieved by the kriging method. The NMB and “d” were minimum for IDW, while NRMSE was minimum for the kriging Gaussian method in all the cases. The results of this study can be used in low-middle-income countries (LMIC) to obtain an aerial view of air quality to help the regulatory bodies in policy formulation and decision-making. This method needs fewer resources and time when compared to setting up new monitoring stations or using dispersion modeling to obtain an aerial perspective.},

	abstract = {Mumbai, a highly populated city in India, has been selected for air quality mapping and assessment of health impact using monitored air quality data. Air quality monitoring networks in Mumbai are operated by National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A monitoring station represents air quality at a particular location, while we need spatial variation for air quality management. Here, air quality monitored data of NEERI and BMC were spatially interpolated using various inbuilt interpolation techniques of ArcGIS. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), Kriging (spherical and Gaussian), and spline techniques have been applied for spatial interpolation for this study. The interpolated results of air pollutants sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were compared with air quality data of MPCB in the same region. Comparison of results showed good agreement for predicted values using IDW and Kriging with observed data. Subsequently, health impact assessment of a ward was carried out based on total population of the ward and air quality monitored data within the ward. Finally, health cost within a ward was estimated on the basis of exposed population. This study helps to estimate the valuation of health damage due to air pollution. Implications: Operating more air quality monitoring stations for measurement of air quality is highly resource intensive in terms of time and cost. The appropriate spatial interpolation techniques can be used to estimate concentration where air quality monitoring stations are not available. Further, health impact assessment for the population of the city and estimation of economic cost of health damage due to ambient air quality can help to make rational control strategies for environmental management. The total health cost for Mumbai city for the year 2012, with a population of 12.4 million, was estimated as USD8000 million.},
